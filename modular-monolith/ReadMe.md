Cargo Tracker Monolith
======================
This is a vanilla Java EE application of moderate complexity. In microservices 
parlance, the application can be considered a monolith.

The code is derived from the [Cargo Tracker](https://m-reza-rahman.github.io/cargo-tracker/) project.


Instructions
------------
* Start NetBeans. There is a Maven project in the directory - cargo-tracker. You 
need to open and build the project in NetBeans.
* You will need to specify that the project will run with Payara. You do that 
by going to Project -> Properties -> Run -> Server and choosing Payara.
* When ready, you need to run the cargo-tracker application (Project -> Run). 
Wait for the project to deploy and run. NetBeans should automatically open a 
browser window with the running application.
* You need to book and route a cargo. Please take a look at the video for the 
Cargo Tracker application on how to do this or look through the readme of the 
Cargo Tracker application.
